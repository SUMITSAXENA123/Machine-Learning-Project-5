# # CODTECHIT SOLUTIONS Machine-Learning-Project-5
**ML project 5- TEXT TO SPEECH GENERATION**

**NAME: SUMIT SAXENA**

**COMPANY: CODTECHIT SOLUTIONS**

**ID: CT4ML5007**

**DOMAIN: MACHINE LEARNING**

**DURATION: JULY 15TH TO AUGUST 15TH, 2024**

**MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR**

**Objective**

**The primary objective of this project is to develop a Text-to-Speech (TTS) application that converts written text into spoken words. This application aims to provide an accessible tool for users, enhancing user experience in reading digital content, supporting visually impaired individuals, and enabling the conversion of text documents into audible formats.**

**Technologies Used**

**Python:** The core programming language used for developing the TTS application due to its simplicity and extensive library support.

**Jupyter Notebook:** An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is used as the primary development environment for this project.


**Python Libraries**

**gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech):** A Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translateâ€™s text-to-speech API. It enables the conversion of text into speech.

**pyttsx3:** An offline Text-to-Speech library in Python that works with multiple TTS engines and allows for greater control over speech properties like rate, volume, and voice.

**IPython.display:** Used in Jupyter Notebooks to display audio widgets directly within the notebook interface.

**os:** A standard Python library to interact with the operating system, used here to save and play audio files.


**Development Environment**
**Jupyter Notebook:** Chosen for its ability to integrate code execution, rich text, and visualizations in a single document, facilitating an interactive development process.
